*(All major planned tasks completed)*

Key Tasks & Bug Verification:
- Verify if the "Number/Symbol Position reverting to append" bug is fully resolved after recent changes. Requires interactive testing.

Ongoing Tasks:
- Review and Curate Word Lists: Continuously refine word lists for memorability, clarity, and distinctiveness (Adjectives, Animals, Colors, Common Objects, Verbs).

Potential Future Enhancements (Lower Priority):
- Improve slider styling/interaction further if needed.
- Add explicit clipboard content check in Playwright tests (if feasible and stable).
- Deploy the application (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

Completed:
- Password strength indicator.
- Playwright tests for UI interactions.
- Edge case handling (ensure one of each selected char type - initial logic for numbers/symbols, then enhanced word selection for categories).
- Unit tests for password generation logic (Vitest).
- Refine styling with Tailwind CSS.
- Implement 'Copy to Clipboard' functionality.
- Connect UI to passwordUtils.ts.
- Implement password generation logic.
- Fix "Prepend" bug.
- Refine Word Categories.
- Address UI asymmetry (layout refactor, number/symbol count inputs).
- Improve "Previous" button styling.
- Implement "Interspersed" number/symbol position.
- Implement input validation/max for numbers/symbols.
- Add "Auto-copy" feature.
- Enhance word selection to ensure one word from each selected category (initial implementation).
