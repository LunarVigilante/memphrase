			<p class="mt-6">
				MemPhrase ("us", "we", or "our") operates the memphrase.example.com website (the "Service").
			</p>
			<p>
				This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-8 mb-3">1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
			<p>
				Since MemPhrase primarily operates client-side for password generation, we <strong>do not collect personal data</strong> for the core password generation service. Settings are stored locally in your browser. We do not use analytics or tracking cookies for the core password generation functionality.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you choose to use our optional Contact Us form, we will collect the information you provide (such as name, email address, and message content) solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-4 mb-2">Types of Data Collected via Contact Form</h3>
			<h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-3 mb-1">Personal Data</h4>
			<p>
				If you use our Contact Us form, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. This information may include, but is not limited to:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
				<li>Full Name</li>
				<li>Email address</li>
				<li>Subject and Message content</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 class="text-md font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-3 mb-1">Usage Data (General Website Visit - If Applicable)</h4>
			<p>
				Our hosting provider may collect standard server logs which can include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages. This data is typically used for website maintenance and aggregated statistical analysis by the hosting provider and is not directly used by MemPhrase to identify individuals.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-6 mb-3">2. Use of Data</h2>
			<p>MemPhrase uses the data collected via the Contact Us form for the following purposes:</p>
			<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
				<li>To respond to your inquiries and provide support.</li>
				<li>To improve our Service based on feedback received.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We do not sell or share your personal data provided through the contact form with third parties, except as required by law.</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-6 mb-3">3. Local Storage of Settings</h2>
			<p>
				MemPhrase utilizes your browser's local storage to save your password generation preferences (such as number of words, selected categories, separator character, etc.) for your convenience. This data is stored directly in your browser and is not transmitted to our servers or to any third party by MemPhrase. You can clear this data by clearing your browser's cache and local storage for this site.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-6 mb-3">4. Security of Data</h2>
			<p>
				The security of your data is important to us. While the core password generation happens on your device and settings are stored locally, any data transmitted via the optional contact form will be handled with care. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any Personal Data you send us, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-6 mb-3">5. Children's Privacy</h2>
			<p>
				Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data via the contact form, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-100 mt-6 mb-3">6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will update the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
